Youtube-Playlist-Manager (indev)
========================

An advanced playlist manager for youtube, that lets you perform various batch actions.
This will become a chrome extension soon.
I was tired of Youtube's default playlist managing capabilities, so I decided to create my own tool using Youtube's API.

Youtube-Playlist-Manager (indev)
========================

An advanced playlist manager for youtube, that lets you perform various batch actions.
This will become a chrome extension soon.
I was tired of Youtube's default playlist managing capabilities, so I decided to create my own tool using Youtube's API.

If you want to host this application yourself, you need to create your own API project [here](https://code.google.com/apis/console/)  
(also enable the Youtube API v3) and then replace the `client_id` with yours [here](https://github.com/elias94xx/Youtube-Playlist-Manager/blob/master/js/utils.js#L11).
